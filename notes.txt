** Vehicle Type **
Vehicle Type did not add anything, we will ask the other system to filter out cars before implementing.
As the calling system needed to use objects in this system before, and this system was incomplete, this should be a considerable improvement for all parties.
If the calling system is unable to filter out cars, then Vehicle Type can be passed as a String for ease of integration.
