/**
 * HolidayOrWeekendChecker is not currently not in use pending cache eviction strategy during production.
 * But using {@link HolidayOrWeekendCheckerTest#perf()} A  performance enhancement could be noted (60% on my machine).
 * Makes sense since the same date will occur many many times as many daily passages is the root cause for having a toll in the first place
 * The cache should probably be warmed-up as we know all keys will be used eventually. E.g populate all possible dayOfYear eagerly.
